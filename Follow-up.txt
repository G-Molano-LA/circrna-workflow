1. Down-sampling FASTQ files automatically: `down_sampling.sh` file
2. Removing an specific termination from filenames: `filenames.sh` file.
  a. Complementary modification of `reading files` section in `alignment_and_identification.Snakefile`.
  b. Generation of `seqs.txt` from `filenames.sh` execution

3. DE analysis
  a. Start with results from `alignment_and_identification` snakefile.
    a. Prepare input for `circ_DE.R`script.
  b. consider the option of using CIRIquant.
    a. Run CIRIquant
    b. Understand results and prepare them for `circ_DE.R`script. Possible useful script:`prep_DE.py`

4. Data visualization:
  a. Still trying to work with CircView tool

5. Network and enrichment

1. CIRI_simulator.pl = failed to used cause it requires high amounts of RAM
2. Down-sampling FASTQ files (subsample): seqtk tool = https://github.com/lh3/seqtk
3. Differential expression analysis: solved.
  3.1. circrna features appears in DE list
  3.2. CIRIquant performs DE analysis for replicates with CIRI_DE_replicate command,
   which uses `replicate.py` script. That python script redirects to an R script `CIRI_DE.R`.
  3.3. CIRIquant DE analysis is only though for experiment design with one factor.
   Maybe I could introduce the option of defining your design.
  3.4. Integrate DE in the workflow
