1. CIRI_simulator.pl = failed to used cause it requires high amounts of RAM
2. Down-sampling FASTQ files (subsample): seqtk tool = https://github.com/lh3/seqtk
3. Differential expression analysis: solved.
  3.1. circrna features appears in DE list
  3.2. CIRIquant performs DE analysis for replicates with CIRI_DE_replicate command,
      which uses `replicate.py` script. That python script redirects to an R script `CIRI_DE.R`.
  3.3. CIRIquant DE analysis is only though for experiment design with one factor. Maybe
      I could introduce the option of defining your design.
  3.4. Integrate DE in the workflow
